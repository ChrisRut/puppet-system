0.5.2:

* limits: Fixed examples to show changes due to multiple entry support

* Actually fix the typo in mounts.pp preventing it from working!

* mounts: Updated example to show an NFS share

* example.yaml: Added files examples

* sysctl: Added a note to quote numeric values to avoid "can't convert Fixnum
into String" errors

* yumgroups: added a usecache option for when 'yum -C grouplist' does not work

0.5.1:

* Added 'files' to create directories and populate the content of files.  The
initial reason was to create mount points for NFS shares.

* Fixed typo in mounts.pp preventing it from working.

* Run 'mounts' in the last stage so that any required users, groups and mount
points can be created first.

* Require augeasproviders > 0.5.1 to get bug fix for problems running under
'puppet apply'.

* Require limits > 0.3.1 as this allows more than one entry per user or group.
