0.6.0:

* Refactoring to make it easier to use without hiera (ie. just as
parameterised classes).  

* Added an exclude parameter so that particular system classes can be excluded
when doing 'include system', which is useful when testing or debugging issues
or just to prevent config lower in the hierarchy being applied

* Added support for schedules so that configuration does not need to be
applied with every Puppet run

* Changed the yumgroup type to have a default 'daily' schedule to reduce the
time Puppet runs take - package group changes are usually rare after the host
is first set up.  Users can override this by supplying their own schedule.

0.5.3:

* Added 'crontabs' to create user crontab entries

* Added 'execs' to run idempotent external commands

0.5.2:

* limits: Fixed examples to show changes due to multiple entry support

* Actually fix the typo in mounts.pp preventing it from working!

* mounts: Updated example to show an NFS share

* example.yaml: Added files examples

* sysctl: Added a note to quote numeric values to avoid "can't convert Fixnum
into String" errors

* yumgroups: added a usecache option for when 'yum -C grouplist' does not work

0.5.1:

* Added 'files' to create directories and populate the content of files.  The
initial reason was to create mount points for NFS shares.

* Fixed typo in mounts.pp preventing it from working.

* Run 'mounts' in the last stage so that any required users, groups and mount
points can be created first.

* Require augeasproviders > 0.5.1 to get bug fix for problems running under
'puppet apply'.

* Require limits > 0.3.1 as this allows more than one entry per user or group.
